    <p>
        My name is Alexander Lockard and I am a Computer Science major at Florida Institute of Technology graduating in December of 2024. I have a deep passion in harness AI and Machine Learning to provide the analytics needed to make smarter decisions. I am currently working as a software engineering intern at Modus Operandi where I have been since June of 2023. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, the outdoors, and going for long runs. My main areas of interest are in Computer Networks and AI/ML.
